## Description

A ready to use scientific blog for writing research and machine learning demos, easy to customize .

## Features:

- Easy editable content in **Markdown** files (posts, pages and parts) via **graphQl**
- **Tensorflowjs** integration , modified the react [**tfjx**](https://github.com/ModelDepot/tfjsx) package to work with gatsby
- **chartjs** integration instead of plotly , plotly doesnt compile when deploying. so I used react-chartjs,
  useful to see loss and accuracy functions and other charts you might have.

- **csv** plugin support to work with csv files data
- **graph** plugin to work with graphical schemes in your markdown files using **mermaid**
